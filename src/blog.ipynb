My bot would then check URLs against those contained in the robot.txt file and would return a \"robot.txt error\" rather than crawl the forbidden URL:"

    "While the lack of covariates in my causal forest risks a biased causal estimate, my data appears to predict that if we treat a force area with an additional £1m in reserves then we can expect crime rate to INCREASE by 0.32 crimes per 1,000 population. Without scrutiny, a policy maker could conclude that the way to decrease the crime rate is to cut the amount held in reserves. Perhaps this is because the resources held in reserves are considered more effective in cutting crime rate when the reserves are actually spent/invested, and it is therefore inefficient to hold any reserves. However, in practice it is likely that every force needs some minimum amount in reserves to even exist as a functioning force area. As such, maybe the treatment effect is nonlinear, meaning that the increase in crime rate associated with a reduction in reserves becomes smaller and even negative as the value of amount held in reserves decreases. The next causal forest will check explicitly for non-linearity of the treatment:"
